# Numerical Integration

## Installation:
1. Download the latest release from https://github.com/JoshingJohnson/Numerical-Integration/releases/tag/Install and open the zip file
2. Run the setup

## Features:
### -Supports Rectangle, Trapezoidal, Simpson, and Hit-Miss Monte Carlo Numerical Integration methods
### -A best integral is found via the averaging monte carlo method, which I'd like to add to the features soon.
### -There is a half-finished "dimensions" part of the program, however I havn't been able to find much on numerical integration with more dimensions, so Ignore it.
### -There are many toggleable options of what to display on the graph, for each method there is: A plot of the method against n, the error, the logaritm of the error, and an explaination. Additonally the function and the bestest estimate of the integral can also be plotted.
### -Graphs can be exported by right clicking on the graph in the program, then saving as a png.
